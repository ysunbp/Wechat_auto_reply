# Wechat autoreply
This is a developing wechat autoreply script. Nowaday, more and more people spend their life on social networking, wechat is an important app we
use to communicate with other people. However, unlike many other software, wechat do not have an autoreplying function for users to automatically
reply to friends' messages when they leave. This is the initiative I develop this wechat autoreplying script.

Upon receiving the message, it will automatically send a default reply message to the text sender while forward the message received to filehelper
with time and contact information. 

The key module it utilizing is itchat module in Python 3. It's just a prototype and the functions have not been fully developed. Further improvement
will focus on artificial intelligence to provide more natural and interesting reply for the users.
